## Barebone Framework
#####Not finished. You shouldn't use it for real things yet!
It's framework inspired by Bootstrap and Angular Material but instead of offering whole bunch of code you probably don't need, it is basic framework with only core components that can be expanded by you to make it suits your needs.

## Usage
It should be developed with SASS and not CSS. It provides variables/mixins/functions that you can use in your project SASS file to build on top of framework. Framework is not standalone like Bootstrap but you should build on top of it.


## Core Components
 - Basic Tpography (Material Design)
 - Responsive Design (Flex Box)
 - Color Pallet (Material Design)
 - Helpers Classes
 - Maybe more in future!
 
 
## Why did i make this
I wanted framework that doesn't have all the styling that I don't need. Something that provides basic tools that I can use to build apps on top of.
