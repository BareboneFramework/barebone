## Barebone Framework
#####Not Production Ready
It's framework inspired by Bootstrap and Angular Material but instead of offering whole bunch of code you probably don't need, it is basic framework with only core components that can be expanded by you to make it suits your needs.

## Usage
It should be developed with SASS and not CSS. It provides variables/mixins/functions that you can use in your project SASS file to build on top of framework. In feature there will be extension that will also use this core files to give you more full framework like Bootstrap but still giving you freedom to chose which extensions you want.


## Core Components
 - Basic Typography (Material Design)
 - Responsive Design (Flex Box)
 - Color Pallet (Material Design)
 - Fully configurable framework
 
 
## Why did i make this
I wanted framework that i can customize to my needs. Something that provides basic tools that I can use to build websites on top of.
